mod_simpletubelist
==================

This module simply shows youtube videos when selected on a dropdown list. The main of the few parameters is a textarea containing on each line the ID of the youtube video, followed by a custon title, if desired. If title is missing, the module can get it directly from youtube.com. The videos are presented in a responsive way, but user can easely change its style.

Simple Youtube List module works in both, Joomla 2.5.x & Joomla 3.x. It only requieres JavaScript to function propertly.
